      "message": "2 issues here.\nFirst, labeled break is a java-ism, there\u0027s no such thing in C. do a \"goto out\" statement, it\u0027s very popular in the kernel.\nSecondly, the return value is ssize_t (signed) while the count variable is size_t (unsigned). I\u0027m afraid it might be problematic to assign a signed value (-EINVAL) to an unsigned variable. I would create a ssize_t rc, which I\u0027d set to -EINVAL in this if() block, and to \"count\" right before the \"out\" label.\nAlso very minor: coding style would require a space here \"){\".",
